# 3B Bot (BiriBiriBot) in C

A chatbot with psychological problems - communicate with it if you're tough enough. This chatbot was created some years ago as a uni project. It is written in C and has many nice features. It can learn and forget things (like insertion and deletion in a database) but by using circular singly linked lists in C. It can answer questions about what it knows and random questions sometimes too
